# Software Engineering Final Exam AA 2020/2021

The goal of the project is to create a digital version of the board game [Masters of the Renaissance](https://www.craniocreations.it/prodotto/masters-of-renaissance/) as a distributed system consisting of a single server capable of managing one game and multiple clients using the MVC pattern.

### Requirements :white_check_mark:
The following requirements were covered in the development of the project:
- [x] **Complete Rules**
- [x] **CLI** && **GUI**
- [x] **Communication Protocol** (Socket)
- [x] **Advanced Features: Local Game**
- [x] **Advanced Features: Resilience to Disconnections**

### UML :bar_chart:
The class diagrams of the model are shown below. The initial UML was done in the design phase, while the final UML was generated by intelliJ. There are no substantial differences between the 2 graphs. There is also a chart showing the inheritance between classes
